<h3>This is the crazy funnel-pancake</h3>
<p>In today's episode of Cooking With Schaef â„¢ we will be preparing a miracle meal.  With only three (that's right, three!) ingredients*, we will be making a meal that will be sure to have your family begging for more!<br>

    Warning: this meal will break your diet.  In fact, reading the recipe may break your diet. <br>
    
   
     
<ul>

    <li>Bacon</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Pancake Box mix</li>
</ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Start with 3lbs of bacon.  Layer them in a large pan with tall sides (to minimize mess).  Start with temperature at medium until fat starts to render, then raise temperature to medium-high.  Turn regularly until bacon is cooked to desired tenderness.  This method of cooking sounds like pure blasphemy, until youve tried it.  The bacon isn't cooked in the traditional way, but is instead basically deep fried in its own rendered fat.  It also doesn't produce that much mess, because the bacon on top blocks most of the "splattering mess."  You have to try it.
        </l1>
        <li>
        As the bacon is nearing completion, start mixing up a box of premade pancake mix*.  I personally prefer to use milk instead of water, even though you could get by with water in a pinch.  Make your mix a teensy bit runnier than you usually would.
    </l1><li>
        Remove the bacon from the pan but LEAVE THE 2-3inches of bacon grease in the pan!
    </l1><li>
        Now, begin dipping pancake batter into the pan, as if you were making a pancake.  You'll know the grease is hot enough if the pancake begins separating slightly and cooking instantly.  After about 15 seconds, flip the "pancake" over.  15 more seconds and remove.  
    </l1>
